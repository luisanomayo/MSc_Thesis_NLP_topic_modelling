People who don't come to a full stop at a stop sign can't be trusted to handle details. They literally and figuratively cut corners, both on the street and in the workplace. Tailgating. People who tailgate (i.e. leave less than one car length per 10 mph) are unimaginative. They assume that nothing can go wrong and are caught by surprise when the unexpected happens. Road Hogging. A road hog insists on going either below or at the speed limit rather than pulling over and letting a line of cars pass them. This is classic passive-aggression; road hogs will bog down any and all initiatives at work. Finger Salutes. People who feel it necessary to express profanity at other drivers (especially while driving away) are usually frustrated and a bit cowardly. At work, they can be counted on to backbite and gossip. Over-honking. These are people who honk longer than necessary, like a full second (rather than a polite tap) at a driver who hasn't noticed the light has changed. Over-honkers tend to be both overly-critical and overly-sensitive to being criticized. Texting. Driving while texting is more dangerous than driving while drunk. Anybody who texts or emails while driving is a dangerous fool and cannot be trusted with any responsibility whatsoever, at work or anywhere else. Speeding. Habitual speeders are like my former boss. They don't really care about other people and they don't think the rules apply to them. At work, they are the jerks that make everyone else miserable."", 'Remember, some dozen delivery guys lost their live post Covid-19 things and this guy is desperate to stick anything to make his bike 🏍 more visible, I think. ""Ras Al Khaimah Police have revealed an uptick in motorbike accidents, thanks to a surge in demand for delivery services since the beginning of the pandemic. According to a report in Emarat Al Youm, Ras Al Khaimah Police said that the emirate recorded the death of one motorcycle rider during the first quarter of this year. In an awareness report issued by Ras Al Khaimah Police, it explained that motorcycle riders who do not abide by safety rules and speed limits are putting their lives in danger. The Acting Director of Traffic Awareness and Information Branch, First Lieutenant Hamdan Hassan Al Habsi, stated that due to the increase of delivery services and the rate of accidents and violations of riders, authorities introduced standards and specifications required for motorcycle riders. He explained that some riders fail to abide by the rules as they are focused on delivering their services quickly. He added that riders should follow instructions, respect traffic lights, abide by road signs, wear a helmet to protect them from injuries, not overtake vehicles incorrectly, and not ride on pavements and pedestrian crossings. He pointed out that the Ministry of Interior had previously warned motorists against endangering the lives of delivery service workers, as the ministry noticed some negative practices committed by some drivers against riders, such as violating their right to the road and swerving suddenly, which puts their lives at risk.""', ""I have answered already in Reddit standards . Now that you are pushing me to quora standards, let me take that route for the benefit of most here /a Majority of the founders of tech companies and startups in India and in the valley are IIT and IIM grads. A lot of them are investors. Majority of the VCs globally are IIT IIM grads who are aware of the quality of students who enroll in IITs. Now, IITians would get easy access to these guys + they also have the reputation of being smart and hardworking. IITs do not have the R&D facilities and super high quality profs that US universities have. Their game is to compete against very sharp peers and learn stuff beyond the curriculam. Also to follow the path that their seniors have set. Intelligent indian students who study here can live at home and study in IITs. Am guessing admission will be slightly easier for them. They don't have to go elsewhere and end up being jobless there and come back here to struggle. Now, a lot IITians would take entrepreneurship route and will actually screw the existing Tech Industry here that predominantly are run by low quality desi, regional and western entrepreuners. So this place is likely to understand what actually is tech industry. These guys will create employment for smart people. They get funded easily by global VCs etc. Rest of them who want to work becomes high quality qualified work force that feeds the global company needs to set up devt centers here etc. These guys will drive that change and fill the skill gap. That'll also help students from other average universities here . Now, Emirati students and others will get to see how prestigious is to study in IIT and the smart one's from that cluster would make attempts to join them. Government would also take efforts to educate the community about this institution and motivate sharp kids to study there competing with smart peer group. That is likely to increase the competitiveness quotient. Imagine this cycle in 10 years time frame and you'll get the drift. As I said earlier, govt gets a lot of advice from top consulting firms. It's not like they jump and take such decision to go and request India to bring IIT here. It is a well articulated long term strategy to change the tech landscape here and to bring in smart and hardworking culture.""]"
1,0,6506,0_uae_sharjah_visa_salary,"['uae', 'sharjah', 'visa', 'salary', 'live', 'zayed', 'jobs', 'emirates id', 'middle', 'expats']","[""I assume it's 50k AED a month, thus 600k AED a year. Thus: (1) Being Captain Obvious, that's about £120k sterling a year which is tax free. Thus saving about £45k a year sterling in tax. An increase of 60% on your current base. (2) I don't put a huge amount of faith in bonuses, since in my segment of professional services they are used to as an enticement but never have much bite for various reasons - most people get screwed on the bonus, have to work for a certain amount of time to get it, then subject to review, then they get screwed (great job, nearly there, keep fighting, here are some development areas you need), then it's 6 more months to get it and if you resign before then, no bonus etc etc. But yes, ofc it has some merit. (3) Cost of living in Dubai vs UK - add about £5k a year sterling (per person) to Dubai's excluding accommodation. It's very individual, but groceries are more expensive, entertainment / going out; if you don't drive, you'll taxi everywhere (cheap but they add up), and you need to consider the cost of flights and accommodation back to and in the UK. I'm assuming you come back 4 times a year economy, you'll easily blow through the £5k. You'll probably do brunches, stuff at beach clubs without going wild, but you have to be conscious of this. It's like you won't go out of your way to spend money, but if you put yourself in certain situations in Dubai inadverently you will spend money faster. (4) Cost of a 1 bed in a decent locale is about £16-17k sterling, but bills are pricey and more than the UK, so you'll end up pushing £20k. Usually you sign up for a year, although there may be alternative arrangements out there. A key factor is whether you own property in the UK. If you don't own property in the UK, remember as an expat in Dubai, you can only get BTLs, not resi mortgages, which requires a 25% deposit, and you'll pay a lot more potentially on stamp, you'll be on a sh1tty interest only mortgage. You still get your personal allowance though. Point I'm making is you're throwing £17k of your earnings at a foreign landlord rather than putting money into a house you own, paying relatively cheap debt of £3-7k annually, and getting house price appreciation. If you own your own property in the UK, let it out and happy days, take advantage of the personal allowance for additional income. I think this works out well because you're offsetting your bills and accommodation in Dubai, without buying in Dubai which is expensive in terms of execution, and has historically had a bit of an up and down / flat market, where your place in the UK will likely continue to appreciate. So that's my take on the costs. Is it worth it from a financial perspective? Yes, at first sight. But also depends on what your wife does, (does she work, has she got a job in the UK, or one planned in Dubai?). If she doesn't and/or you don't own property in the UK, it's not the bargain it appears to be on the face of it, but you'll still probably be better off in Dubai. Ultimately then it depends if you want to come to Dubai or not. If you do, you'll have a nice flat, probably bigger and nicer where you are in the UK, you'll have a nice car, you'll eat out in nice restaurants, you'll exercise at nice gyms, and the weather will be lovely for half the year, your working hours will be reduced in April and when it's boiling in Dubai, you'll have some nice holidays in Europe. Depends what else is going for you in the UK."", ""What would you choose (assume you are a man with a wife and child, but have little by the way of education). * Live in the UAE getting paid 2000-3000AED/month performing hard manual labour in hot conditions. Can't take family to UAE (not allowed by company). Live in shared accommodation (can't afford to live by yourself). Can't afford a car. Little to no money to eat at restaurants or spend money on leisure activities. * Live in a western country (assume UK for this example, but the same thoughts apply for several other western nations), where you work the same job but get paid more (ie assuming UK minimum wage of £9.50/hour, 40 hour week, 50 weeks per year as construction industry shuts down over late December and early January) you'd earn £1411/month after tax or 6211AED/month). The key different being you're not working in 40C heat for 7 months of the year, have workers rights, can take your family to live with you, the child can can go to school (for free or for very little cost) and have access to good education at western universities, can afford a car, have access to public funded healthcare (which is paid for via taxes) etc etc. So why do people come to Dubai? UK (as well as many other western nations) have strict entry requirements, encompassing education and profession (ie your job). Unless you have money (ie which allows you to study or use another pathway to enter a western nation), win some sort of visa (ie green card in USA), granted asylum, or get a job which allows you to get a job in a western nation, there is no next to no chance a person with little money, skill or education can get across to a western nation. On the other hand, the UAE makes it easy to attract such workers, but works people very hard... I gather (from your previous posts) you're either an emirati (or a GCC citizen). Let me ask you this: Would you want to work outside in 40c heat for 7 months of the year for 5000AED/month? Would you want to work as a cashier at a supermarket for 3000AED/month? I don't think you (and to be frank, many western people who come to the UAE and other GCC countries earning high wages) truly understand how blessed and lucky you are..."", ""Today, I may have heard the most BS thing that came out of a person's mouth from Dubai. But it could also be true. For context, I'm working in a software company where I am working as a creative director. I am also Filipino. Earlier today, I had a call with the company owner. He talked me through a huge project that he wants me to lead in the near future. Basically, he's forming a new design agency company that he wants me to spearhead and set up from scratch. Then he pep-talked me about it and he mentioned how our past arguments made him think that I whine a lot and that he doesn't want that kind of 'negativity' in the future. For context again, the 'whining' part that he's talking about was when we had a huge argument when he had me migrate from the Philippines to Dubai and offered me a salary that is not proportionate to my position. And his reason back then was that I was Filipino. So I shouldn't expect to have the same salary as a westerner would get with the same job. Back then, I just had to believe it because it was my first time migrating to a different country with a different culture. But as the years went by, I have had a lot of Filipino friends who are earning way more than me (I would say that it's almost or are already at the level of western designers of the same work experience) but are in positions that are lesser work responsibilities than mine. So back to our call earlier, he reiterated his stance about the salary. To sum up what he said, he explains that if business owners in Dubai want to have employees with an American or Canadian mentality, they will have to offer huge salaries to move them from North America because they are already earning a lot there. But if they wanted people who have an Asian mentality like Indians or Filipinos, they only had to offer more than what they would earn in their home country to entice them to move to Dubai. Now honestly when I heard that, I was offended and it could be the most BS thing I have ever heard from someone here in Dubai. But I can't help to believe that what he's saying is partly true. But you know what's also true? Costs here don't vary depending on your passport. A 2 dirham Karak will cost 2 dirhams for a westerner and for a Filipino like me. My rent costs the same if a westerner was living here instead of me. I literally have no hate for Westerners. I have a lot of friends from America, Canada, and Europe. What I hate are these business owners trying to exploit and abuse an already problematic system. To be honest, I feel like he knows that I can pull off this new project and it doesn't need any mentality from a specific race to make it happen. But he just wants to set my mind to not expecting a huge salary when I start running that company. So now my game plan is to suck it up and let the new company kick-off led by me. Once the company has a decent portfolio for the first year, I will resign with a banger of a resume. EDIT: Just wanted to be clear that I am going to continue leading the project even with shit pay because the opportunity to have that experience in my CV is definitely desirable. I can quit now and perhaps find a better job with better pay, but I can hold on for a year and lead the new design firm, then resign with an amazing CV that will surely give me a better career opportunity and definitely better pay. The experience that I will get just might break the racial walls towards me when I apply for a new company based on my achievements alone.""]"

If you care to listen, I would love to explain my perspective. The labourers being exploited and slave labour is a 2000-2012 narrative. After that period, the labourers know what they are singing up for. During the early 2000s there were ""manpower supplies"" companies that had recruiting agents in various countries, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines and even North Korea. These companies would make false promises and take loads of money upfront, guaranteeing people various jobs in well placed companies and trap them into working for measly wages as these people were burdened with loans they took in the first place to get the job. Today, this is a very well known scam - people from the countries mentioned above have enough horror stories from their neighbours/friends/relatives/townsfolks to understand not.to fall for it, not to mention government awareness programs at a grass root level. Therefore, these labourers come from a background where they are grateful to be employed and to be able to provide the basic necessities to their families back home, as their families are literally starving to death on the streets or homes that are barely holding themselves up. They\'re a slave to their destiny. The destiny which was not created just by the Gods but by their chosen leaders of their country. Let\'s take India, since I know that the best - farmer suicides, I\'m sure you\'ve heard of that - it\'s the same farmers family members that have decided to come here and work as labourers so that their families can have at least ONE meal a day. Your garbage is literally their luxury. Nepal - the massive earthquake, can\'t remember around 2014 or something, that\'s another cause for cheap labour. Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan poverty and starvation is rampant enough that a AED 900 , accomodation and three meals a day is better than nothing. Now, why cheap labour? government contracts and China. China as a country can put it\'s human resource capital might behind construction projects. That\'s human capital exploitation on mammoth scales. They underbid for almost all construction projects and can manipulate the pre qualifications. Nobody can question China. So to keep up other companies need to compete and that\'s driving the market to not consider the labourers situation. War, civil war and unrest caused by multiple political factors. It\'s quiet simple really, if you don\'t have money, you\'re f***d. Everybody is just trying to make the best out of their situations. It\'s as simple as that. The best solution, be kind to them when you can. The top post here, I saw someone mention Smart Life, it\'s an excellent organization. Do your bit. That\'s about it.', ""I tend to disagree with most of the replies to this post, though I agree that the way this has been communicated to you is disrespectful and the whole 'mindset' argument is nonsense. Your boss sounds like an asshole and I am not sure I would be able to put up with another year of having to deal with him, particularly on a challenging project where we would have to work together closely. To me it is pretty simple - a company has a job that needs to be done so they go and find someone who can do it for the lowest cost possible. If a Filipino or Indian or Laotian or Russian or Eskimo will do the job for $1000, why would I hire someone at a much higher rate? The flip side is true as well, if I want something done that only someone with a Western / Ivy League / specific background can do then I have to pay a salary that they are willing to accept to do the job. I hear anecdotes all the time of incompetent Westerners being hired for jobs they are not qualified for and can not perform, but this makes little sense to me from a business owner's perspective. I freely admit there are racist and xenophobic company owners out there who may think like this but in my experience, this is not the norm and these businesses often struggle to compete. It is simple supply and demand and has been the entire driving force behind offshoring, where companies have moved jobs to lower-cost markets to avoid having to pay high salaries for something someone would be willing to do for much cheaper. I do not feel bad for the people in the USA who lost their manufacturing jobs to Asia and I do not feel bad for people who come to Dubai to work for less than Western wages. That is how business works, you can choose to participate or not.

Our contract ends in September and i asked the landlord if he is willing to extend the contract another 5 months. I am currently paying 60k per year but the landlord wanted 70k per year, though the next day the landlord said the property is now 75k per year, as according to him this is market value. I have said to the estate agent that there is no chance the property value has risen 15k in 9 months. After discussing the estate agent sent me the following message from the landlord ""You still have some time, no? Please find some other tenant! 70 is too less for 4 cheque."".

Thanks', 'Trying to find the right type of place to live in Dubai... Obviously we want to get the best bang for the buck, but we don\'t mind spending a little more rent for the right place as the rental cost is comparable to medium-tier cities in Canada so we\'re used to that level of rental expenses. Initially we were gonna just go for an apartment/condo rental but the concern is the noise-level. Me and my partner are generally not loud people, but it could get maybe a little loud when I\'m making out with her. Normally I guess the neighbors would put up with it if it happens once in a while but in a super conservative place like Dubai... that could pose a little bit of risk. It also doesn\'t help with the fact that we are not officially married. I understand the law was recently amended so that unmarried couple can live together legally but I feel the social norm/culture would still linger and I\'d be dealing with number of Dubai cops visiting me.

Quite frankly we only moved here for the distance to school. Now in terms of the building itself, I hate it honestly. Yes the price is crazy cheap for rentals and buying but quite frankly in terms of your situation I would look more into the Deira or even Al Hudaibah(my old area where I lived 2 years back). This place is just crap honestly. Especially the overall maintenance and AC fees. Sure it might be cheap and might be nice on paper but the after math is quite horrendous. There are charges on charges on charges. And the community is alsooo quite bad. Most of them are Labourers which is not a bad thing but some of the people are just ridiculous. In fact our old made was here for almost 4 months without a visa and we didn’t even know. Some people are just rude as hell too. And one of the more small issues are the lift. Oh my god. Takes us 15 mins just to get down or go up, their slow and there’s too much traffic! Financially it’s ok honestly, yes it’s cheap on rent or even buying, but the value of the homes when buying are gonna drop more, and it will be like that until dubai land gets more developed which has quite a few years too come, I’m guessing around 7-10 years. If your just looking for a temporary home for like a year or maybe two, sure go ahead but not long term. Maintenance is a headache! AC is extremely expensive. We pay 15k per year just for the AC, which adds up to 47k for us yearly without the taxes and all the blah blah. For us we are renting directly from harbour which is a must honestly, they make the maintenance slightly easier for the first couple of months and sometimes later on. During the time we were moving in, they changed the doors to some metal/wood glossy doors instead of the normal polished wood that you’re supposed to get, they also painted it Shit Brown, no literally. We confronted them about it and they said your old doors are completely broken(which they were(those doors were there since the old tenants)) and they replaced them with those without asking. No even though they said they can change them they told us we’ll take 100 DHS for it, even though the have 10-15 more doors just lying down somewhere.

The change in policy comes as the Dubai-based airline sets to ramp up its flying programme on Monday, June 15 with the addition of 16 new cities joining its network of post-Corona destinations. The carrier first introduced mass COVID-19 testing for pilots and cabin crew in late March, requiring every single crew member to undergo a throat and nose swab test for the novel Coronavirus when they arrived in Dubai after operating a flight. Crew members were also expected to self-quarantine for two weeks, although in recent weeks Dubai and the UAE have made significant steps to ease virus lockdown restrictions. The change in policy at Emirates will align the airline with many of its competitors as well as official guidance from international aviation regulators and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In fact, new advice from the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) says any health screening for crew members should be “as non-invasive as possible”. Instead, crew members are encouraged to take their temperature regularly, report any COVID-19 related symptoms immediately and maintain good hygiene practices. Pilots and cabin crew will now only have to undergo thermal screening on departure and arrival from Dubai International Airport (DXB) unless their temperature is abnormally high. Crew members who fail the temperature screening will continue to have a COVID-19 test. From tomorrow, Emirates will resume regularly scheduled passenger flights to the following destinations: Bahrain, Manchester, Zurich, Vienna, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dublin, New York JFK, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Jakarta, Taipei, Hong Kong, Perth and Brisbane. The carrier has already restarted flights to London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Madrid, Chicago, Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne and Manila. Flights to Kabul, Afghanistan are set to resume on June 25, bringing Emirates’ route network to 30 destinations. Cabin crew will continue to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including surgical masks, goggles, disposable gowns and gloves. Passengers must also wear masks throughout the flight and service has been limited to reduce interaction between crew and passengers.

One time I decided to start talking to them in normal english, unfortunately it has failed as most of my instructions were not understood or misinterpreted, and they won’t tell me that they don’t understand my words so I come to know that after they screw up.

In this post I will mention a detailed experience that I wish I knew before buying the car. This post will contain common-sense information for most people, but for people like me, it would be very useful. # Searching for a used car First of all, there are multiple places where you can find used cars, such as Dubizzle, Facebook Marketplace, and many other websites. My first thoughts were to buy a car from Automall as they tend to have mostly good reviews, but the problem was that they were hella overpriced. I know that they have a warranty, but it's REALLY overpriced. Second thought was to go to Harraj souq, but I have 0 experience in buying a new car so I was advised to stay away from Harraj. I started looking for Dubzzle within my price range and looking at multiple brands, I was filtering to see GCC cars only. But for my low budget I couldn't find but high-mileage cars so I looked at the most reliable cars such as Toyota and Honda. # After you find the car that you think is good, then what? 1. Ask the owner for VIN number ( chassis number ) and search if it has any previous accidents and there are multiple websites for that : ( I used the most ) 2. Ask the owner if he has any service records. They don't have to be from the official showroom, for example, the car that I was inspecting was regularly serviced by AutoPro ( ENOC ) so I called them and pulled all of the service records based on the VIN number provided and, as It turns out the previous owner have done all of the major serviced for the car a couple of months ago and he changed the oil regularly and the car was well maintained, so that's perfect. 3. After that, if the car is good and you liked it, ask the owner for a test drive and garage check The owner of the car that I found was located near Festival City in Dubai and I didn't want to drive too far for a garage, so I searched through Google Maps for the nearest garage with the highest reviews and planned to go there ( 4.5 rating with more than 1000 reviews ). I agreed with the owner and went to the place to test drive and I had a list of things that I should check in the interior and exterior as well. I also had a list of things I should pay attention to during the test drive and all was good. Then we went to the garage. They inspected the car well in an hour or so ( 150 AED charge ) and the report was clean as well beside some minor issue I managed to get a discount on. # Registration process 1. First of all the previous owner had an Abu Dhabi license plate, and I wanted to have the car with Dubai license plates so we went for Dubai Tasjeel at first but they told us that we should visit Sharjah or Abu Dhabi to make the ownership transfer, if the car that you are buying have the same Emirate you just go to Tasjeel and transfer the ownership, both of you should have your Emirates ID with your and car Mulkia. Skip the next part if the car is within the same emirate. 2. We went to Sharjah with the car, and we removed the plates and parked it in a special place nearby for cars without plates, and we went inside and waited for an hour or something, then we made the ownership transfer, which would cost around 550 AED and that's it. After that, you have to take the car to Dubai, but you can't drive it since that car doesn't have a number plate, so we had to take it with a recovery car ( there are lots of recovery cars there ) to take it to Dubai Tasjeel which costs around 120 AED. You have to take a taxi to get there as well ( 50 AED to the nearest Tasjeel in Dubai ) 3. ( TIME SAVING TIP ) Car insurance should be present before registering the car and you can't register the car without it, the center in Tasjeel is overpriced so you better call YallaCompare and send them a copy of the ownership certificate that you acquire and your driving license and Emirates ID and they will give you the best insurance offer, pick the best one for you ( cost me 1000 AED less than the center in Tasjeel and more premium insurance ) and pay online using your card and the insurance will be activated to your car within an hour ( while you finish the car inspection ). 4. Now you are in Dubai with the car with no license plate so while you are waiting for your insurance, you should queue for the inspection and in my case it was like 1 hour of waiting and they inspected the car and gave you the report, then you park the car and go inside the building. 5. ( TIME SAVING TIP ) Check if your car needs oil change or air filter change or tier change or any other service because they have Autopro there and you can change the oil there as well while you are making the registration inside ( Autopro might be overpriced but if your services are not big it won’t make that big of a difference ) 6. Inside the building, take your inspection result and queue for the registration. They are really fast, don't be afraid if you see a lot of people. After that they will check your insurance from their system which YallaCompare should confirm to you that your insurance is online and they will take the new ownership certificate from you and they will ask you if you want big or small number plate so you have to check with your car first and here you will pay registration fees which is around 420 AED. 6. After that you will take your vehicle license from another window and your new number plates as well, don't buy the plastic thing for the number plates unless your car needs it because they are expensive. 7. After that you should buy a new Salik card AND ACTIVATE IT through the app or website. You can buy it from there as well ( 100 AED ), comes with a 50 AED balance as well. 8. Go to your car and remove the old Salik sticker and put the new one and then you will find a guy that will put the new number plate on your car ( 30 AED ) Congratulations, you have now registered your first car in the UAE.""]"

No one is expecting you to cover your hair but some places will expect legs to be covered for example. You can’t get your driving license done if you’re in shorts, for eg. Malls etc all fine - dress as you would in the U.K. You’ll see that a man wouldn’t shake the hand of a woman in an abaya unless she offered first but 80% of local ladies I worked with would do just that. Every Brit man has made this mistake once but they get a smile and an “excuse me” - there’s no situation or offence taken. There’s inherent bias in some interactions. Silly things like someone (tradesman eg) asking to “speak to the boss” - assuming the man of the house is the one paying the bill. You may notice little male-biased norms like assuming “he” if a person is unknown in a scenario you’re describing. This has almost zero impact though, it doesn’t mean anything. There’s no such thing as a joint account. If you have a husband that works, you will be named on the account and NBD bank even give you a lavender coloured “ladies card”. (Not joking). If you have your own salary, there’s no difference in your ability to get an account or anything else. You know those interactions with eg the garage mechanic where you know they’re not taking you as seriously as a woman? You get more of that. It’s normally solved with an assertive tone. Some laws have a male bias but you wouldn’t see any impact day to day. The laws around guardianship etc are v different. If a father dies, guardianship of the children doesn’t automatically go to the mother, they go to the male next of kin. It would be a court issue to resolve. This slight cultural barrier between men and women in places like the UAE means a more respectful relationship actually. I would be amazed if in your whole time in Dubai you get propositioned or get a sexual comment from anyone. It would be considered so awfully rude. If you do, it’ll be from a British real estate agent in Barasti. Any decent company in Dubai will have the same attitude to discrimination to one in the U.K. They’re all working hard to get women on the board, they all review pay grades to ensure equality. If your company doesn’t then it maybe a red flag tbh. I hope this helps. I’m a man so can’t speak with authority but there are plenty of women living there alone and even flat sharing with men.']"

The Qur’an is full of commandments from God hundreds of times to “keep/establish prayer”. A person who didn’t pray will complain to God on judgement day that he used to pass a neighbour who prayed but that neighbour never told him to pray.

Simply being ‘science’ doesn’t make something right. ‘Science’ used to think that illness was as a result of imbalanced humours. The key is finding the right science. Science that has been tested and questioned and shown to be correct by more than one reliable source. That being said - I don’t think that the scientific community in general would argue that mandatory mask usage when outdoors amongst fully vaccinated small groups or pairs is required. Hell - if you go past any informal gathering of people in the desert or beaches or anywhere that the authorities don’t bother to go to, you’ll see countless people not bothering with masks. Labourers too, often don’t bother with masks anymore when they’re outside working. I think that the government should start looking at ways that they can test relaxing certain mandates because although adherence to the rule in this country was (initially at least) very high, I do not expect a global tourist population for Expo in a few months to be so rigorously adherent. It’s usually tourists in the hotels and around the malls that you see not wearing masks even now. (However, I wish that people would realise, when you wear the mask only over your mouth, you might as well not bloody wear it at all! Also, what’s the point in wearing a mask, only to pull it down when you see someone and stop to talk to them???)

I don\'t know how many people I\'m going to trigger by this but thats the goal, to get it out there and to make people realize their mistake. Dear people, Please dress yourself properly when heading out anywhere, even if its just the supermarket. We live in a country that respects everyone\'s traditions and culture so maybe lets learn to respect their culture by covering ourselves properly. This isn\'t the west to wear croptops and sports bras out openly in the malls where clearly there is a sign that says \'please dress appropriately\'.

Clothing should not be transparent, indecently exposing parts of the body or displaying offensive pictures or slogans. Both men and women might feel more comfortable wearing loose-fitting clothes that cover shoulders, arms and legs. Women traveling in the UAE are not expected to cover their heads or wear the traditional Muslim attire.""', '> Right - there\'s plenty of research in the other direction and in indoor settings with high levels of transmission (mid-2021) it would certainly be foolish to argue that it masks would have zero effect vs. no mask mandate at all - that said, moreso with N95s or FFP2 masks, not with some of the cloth stuff I wear for instance. I\'ve read a fair amount of literature arguing for both hypothesis. Most of the studies that came away with the conclusion that indoor mask mandates work were in specific locales or even more zoomed in such as specific buildings, pre and post mask mandate. You can see how that is weaker study design than the alternative of comparing two areas. Not only can you cherry pick your area, you can also ignore similar changes in rates in a place with a mask mandate or not. For example Florida and California had opposing mask policy. If California just implements a mask mandate as their cases start to go down, they can claim it was the masks, but the cases went down similarly in Florida too, in the absence of a mask mandate. (Btw, this actually happened multiple times in 2021.) So its pretty evident to me given all the scope for \'lying with statistics\' the only studies to trust in this matter are studies that compare contiguous locales that doesn\'t have too much of a porous border (this shouldn\'t matter to be honest). Moreover, policy that requires ideal conditions ( properly fitted N95) is not good policy at all. Even the biggest (N) and strongest RCT supporting mask mandates (The Bangladesh study) showed 0 effectiveness for cloth masks across all age groups and 10% for surgical masks only among those above 50. The self reporting incentive in that study was dubious along with the statistical models (they really massaged the data a lot!), they still came away with a 0% real world effect for most people under the conditions the policy is applied. ^ Heres the study, this is the strongest study in favor of masking. > The point is there genuinely was healthcare stress and ATH death levels at the time, so being anti-mask then, while somewhat understandable given concerns about efficacy, was in fact just having a moan. Does what I am saying being sympathetic or not matter when we are having a rational adult conversation on if something works or not? ___________________________________ And also why are we even talking like its 2020? The data is there for you to see in retrospect, mask friendly places in 2022 have had similar aggregate outcomes to places that didn\'t give a shit about masking. Its so clear in retrospect. They didn\'t ""flatten the curve"" any more that places that took no measures to do it. Covid was endemic by mid 2021, there was just no way around it! The end result was going to be the same.']"

Your dad sounds like a saver not a spender. The average spender thinks that by taking out a credit card they can protect themselves from unforeseen expenses, that's a slippery slope, because they've already made the number one mistake of living above their means. If you don't find ways to save early in life you'll find it difficult to adjust to when you are living margin to margin, month to month, on a credit card barely making payments as the interest accrue, just thinking about it gives me stress and anxiety. Just picture this, if you had to lose your job for whatever reason, would you rather lose your job with a credit card or without a credit card. Most people who lost their jobs are struggling with interest payments on basic expenses because they failed to face reality in time. Without a credit card reality is right at your door step at all times, there is not financial safety net you can escape reality with for a little while longer.

Rich people use it to leverage their wealth and poor people use credit cards to survive, if you are young and a fresh graduate you may be somewhere closer to the poor end of the scale. I'm sure there are plenty of success stories of college kids with credit cards, but for the majority it's always been an imaginary license to spend free money, until it's not. I've never needed a credit card, never saw the pros in them only the potential pitfalls and there's never an easy way out of those once you find yourself trapped in one.

After the help from the sub asking us to report it we were able to get the whole amount back. Following this incident my dad had cancelled all the credit cards he had and then applied for a brand new one. This credit card was only used at well known supermarkets/stores and no where dodgy. About 2 weeks back 4 transactions in US dollars took place amounting to a total of 24000dhs. We had reported these transactions to the bank and I had contacted the merchant which was some crypto wallet website. The website said they can’t help because it’s a crypto wallet and once a transaction in bitcoin is made they can’t refund it. The bank informed us 3 days back that they can’t refund the amount as it was a genuine transaction that was done cause otp was used. Do note that my dad didn’t receive any otp in the mobile number or his email (Only his mobile number is linked to the credit card). I know that it is common for Frauds/hackers to change the mobile number linked to otp and getting to access it that way. Following this we reached out to a connection we had at the bank but that yielded no results. Now, my question is other than filing a police report (which usually nothing happens since it’s a cyber transaction crime), is there anything else we can do? Is it worth trying to approach this legally with the bank stating that we didn’t receive any otp etc? Is there any other options we can explore?']"

MANY restaurants run crazy driver-only meals at amazing affordable pricing. MANY of them give free food-packs to riders just after meal-hours, to ensure minimal food waste. There’s 9000 restaurants in Dubai, and there are whole restaurants and businesses that cater to riders meals. This rider has MANY options to serve his needs. Stealing should 100% not be his choice of option to serve his need, and should not be encouraged. Most of the comments calling out problems in the industry, please know that these are problems from 2-4 years ago. Any of these large scale companies RELY on their riders for their companies survival, its continually been in their best interest to ensure rider happiness and they do A LOT, else even the riders leave and move to other companies that care enough (word spreads fast!). The part regarding visa with benefits vs freelance worker is a government issue, and has a spread of views in the right wing vs left wing thought; debates are still on over this in mature markets, and we are yet to see which way the governments formed by people (the democracies) move toward (within 1-2 years max). Not complaining to let it slide doesn’t make the problem go away. In fact it makes the problem bigger. When you speak up and ascertain your voice, only then the message spreads within the community. When you spread the idea (by complaining) that this is NOT okay, will they spread it among their rider-friends, that there ARE consequences for your actions. If you read deep into criminal psychology, you’ll see that getting away from these smaller crimes is what creates the guts to do bigger crimes, leading to future criminals. The rider playing on one’s emotion also makes it worse, because this is the idea that’s spreading right now! Calling him out and him first lying, then responding after being caught that he was ‘hungry’ so he’s looked at sympathetically, is not right. He wanted your meal, a meal that he couldn’t otherwise afford, and he didn’t want to “work his way up” enough for it - and so he shouldn’t be encouraged and must be reported. He’s probably even a good guy generally. Good basic education would help him understand the working of the world we’re in. In case for any reason he missed this part in the education cycle, it’s important for his life learning curve that he goes through the experience of being called out - as everyone here has agreed, lying, stealing, cheating is NOT okay; and we’re only debating on how to tackle this. If you’re religious, then don’t worry - god is there to take care of him and his needs. You don’t need to play god here. You playing god is almost undermining god’s power to take care of his people. You do what’s the right thing to do - and leave the rest to god or the circle of life.']"

The post and the comments below reek of privilege and disconnection from the lower classes. What is a tipping culture? You're right in saying that it is a way of shifting the cost of wages onto the consumer by the employer. It is how the tipping culture you speak of evolved in the States. When wages are repressed and not sufficient enough to cover basic the cost of living, people seeking out any additional form of income available to them. Are they wrong to do so? Most are just trying to survive and are not using your tips to buy the next iteration of the iPhone. You talk about tipping insulating employers from paying their staff a living wage. Would you refusing to tip the workers, get them higher wages? Are they allowed to form unions to demand higher wages? Is anyone else going to step in to demand higher wages for them?

Especially in establishments that add a service charge by default. Although, I have to say it's not entirely new here, either. For over three decades, I've seen, for example, Emirati men hand cleaners and toilet attendants a 5-Dirham note or at least some coins on their way out of public toilets.

And this is what I basically did to level up, every 3-4 years I would start looking for jobs and identify what the flavour of the week was in IT and learn that to jump up. There was only one company where I stayed for more than 7 years and that was because I was getting 1500 dhs pay boosts every year because of a combination of luck (the company was doing extremely well) and I was pulling long hours. Another point I would like to make is that IT in general is not just a job. If staring at a screen and making things work by trial and error and spending hours googling stuff (atleast until you are familiar with the tech) is part of the job. A lot of the jobs I took initially before I had the necessary experience to make a good jump were what a lot of people would call exploitative. But that's part of what being someone young and having no experience is. IT jobs are a grind.. you will be working long hours, it was a blessing for me as my home life wasn't great. At my first job, I was going between customers in shared taxis and buses, I would come home drenched in sweat, and have to meet my friends sometimes looking like I was working a labour job. They eventually gave me a car to drive around, but it didn't have a valid registration or AC, so not much of an upgrade. Was it exploitative? Yes.. but I gained the experience I needed to move on. I agree with one point though, IT jobs pay similarly almost everywhere once you reach the OEM level, which was my final goal and I got to. So, if you are from the subcontinent or even a lot of countries in the middle East, it would be better to establish yourself in your home country, Dubai has a way of squeezing every last dirham from you if you are not careful and willing to be seen as someone cheap. I have friends who are careful with their money, and they are made fun of openly due to the bullshit show off lifestyle in Dubai. You have the tools at your grasp as long as you have a laptop, I had a PC that was my most valued possession. You need to have the will to do whatever it takes to make it. One additional tip, I never understand anything the first time I watch it or read it. If it is a complex topic, I may read or watch stuff multiple times to be able to remember and understand it. And if you watch something and sleep on it and watch it again, it helps your ability to understand greatly. Don't stress yourself out if you don't get it. I options trade in my spare time and honestly, that was probably the most foreign concept for me. All I did was watch every single video about options trading till I understood it, I didn't beat myself up if it took me 10 different watches to understand the same concept."", 'I see your comments my comrades. Interesting how many are stuck in a career rut. It has its pros and cons. My only advice is to never give up. How I\'m trying to tackle this problem: 1. Firstly try to maintain your relevance and importance at work...if you\'re not in a financial or work/life position to quit. If you\'re able to quit and survive for six months out here and focus full time on a job search, and able to secure visa for that long etc.... by all means do it. 2. Rack up on a certification or two. No need to shell out 100K dirhams for a Masters. I mean great if you can but it\'s not a must. Certifications, skills, etc for free + low budget (ie max 5000 dirhams for a 3 month Harvard program...). Lots of free stuff on Google, or you can pay the monthly LinkedIn fee and do LinkedIn learning. 3. Speaking of LinkedIn. Don\'t be cringe level, but post an article every week or so. Comment on relevant topics where you can add your valued expertise. 4. Reach out to recruiters and engage with them. Show them that you\'re serious about shifting / moving. LinkedIn, word of mouth, face to face, your friends. Maybe a trustworthy colleague or two at work...though that can be risky but I\'ve seen people from within help people get the f*ck out of their rut. 5. Apply to relevant jobs, customize your resume and cover letter accordingly. 6. If when you get an interview, try to get a reference from a friend inside. I\'ve done this and it speeds up the process. Though I ended up not winning the final interviews...lol obviously that\'s on me. 7. Yeah, so practice your interviewing. A lot of interviews are casual conversations, but don\'t take it too casually. This is where you casually show off your expertise and ability to express your ideas and added value. There is hope.

I see kids being menaces and just assume they have crap parents. Lol, I\'m quite pleased you get a sense that I\'m not a parent, and I won\'t try to sway you in any direction regarding. One truly cannot compare having a child on a flight to having a child in a movie theater, your kid\'s being snotty in the movies? Walk them out, calm them down. Now what are you gonna do if the kid\'s acting up on a plane? I mean though, if your kid\'s on a plane kicking the seat in front of them, being loud and disruptive... surely, there must be something that can be done, and I imagine you can\'t walk them off the plane until they calm down. I also believe that children should be respected, just because I say parent your child, or discipline your child doesn\'t mean I don\'t think they should be treated with respect. I will not be parenting anyone\'s children, people take great offence to that. People can feel however they want to feel, as long as they know better than to act on it.

The main reason any of these diets work is because of CICO (calories in calories out). You just have to burn more than you eat, simple as. There’re no shortcuts, and weight loss takes time and dedication. This doesn’t necessarily mean going hungry all the time, or just cutting out entire food groups. It means replacing your meal choices with healthier, low calorie-dense foods which are simultaneously nutritious. Looking good is a good goal. But feeling good physically and mentally is arguably more important. So you need to make lifestyle changes and avoid any, and I do mean ANY, advice which espouses quick fixes. You do it slowly, with reasonable goals. Try to do it too quick, and you’re at risk of burning out and undoing all your progress. The guy above is correct when he says you need to calculate your TDEE. Bare in mind, tdee calculators aren’t always 100% accurate, and may be off by hundreds of calories. Here’s the advice I can give you: 1) Do strength training with progressive overload. It has a plethora of health benefits, and will help you build calorically-expensive muscle. You don’t specifically need to follow any celeb-of-the-week routine. Bench press, pull downs/pull ups, squats/lunges, deadlifts and shoulder presses are the cornerstones of any good training program. If you technically just stick to these with proper form and slowly increase your reps/weight, you will progress. Do the same reps/weight for months on end and you will stagnate because the body will adapt and see no reason to build more muscle. Above all, do it with proper form and start light. If you feel any pain, LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. 2) Increase your N.E.A.T. by being more active throughout the day. Simple things like house chores, parking further away and walking to your destination, whatever. 3) You mentioned that you used to run but are unable to anymore at the same pace. Keep at it. You’ll be able to work your way back to it. Cardio’s good for the heart and also helps to burn calories. 4) What you eat is what reflects on your body. Pay attention to calories. It seems daunting at first, but becomes progressively easier. As long as you are in a caloric deficit, you will lose weight. In fact, eating right is so important that it is possible to lose weight through diet without exercise, but not the other way around. Fast weight loss is not sustainable and generally comes at the expense of muscle. Depending on your starting weight, aim for 500 grams a week, which is actually amazing if you see what a kilo or 2 of fat actually looks like (google it). It doesn’t matter if you lose even 100 grams a week (of fat. If you’re weight training, you will also gain muscle, so don’t assume that you haven’t lost weight just because the needle on the scale didn’t move. Muscle builds slowly, though, and the amount you build depends on your starting level and genetics). At times, you may plateau. It’s fine. Eventually, the numbers will go down. Keep a reasonable time line of at least 6+ months. 5) Sleep. Extremely important for muscle repair, energy for workouts, and most essentially, for mental health. 6) Hydrate. I doubt I need to explain why. But the main point of all these tips is that you need to be patient, make lifestyle changes, and stick with them. Doing this just to build a better looking physique is incentive enough for some. But the fact that it reduces the risks of a variety of diseases, especially as you age, is far, far more vital. Edit: When weight training, remember to space your workouts for recovery. Muscles grow outside the gym, not in it. Recovery is also essential to prevent injury and overtraining, especially since you (hopefully) will not be using PEDs.']"

Would she have behaved this way to a white man or Emirati? She clearly picked on you both for your South Asian and African descent. I know that going through with a police case is a lot of hassle, but if you drop the case, it only emboldens these people who think that they can get away with racism either if they: (1) Falsely accuse without proof OR (2) When proof of their misdemeanour is presented, cry and beg to be let off and cook up stories on stress etc. A woman falsely accusing a man of rape or pedophilia is as bad a man physically molesting a woman. The emotional damage and societal damage to the victim is many times the same. I would have been okay with the pardon if the worst thing someone said to you is some unparliamentary language. But accusing pedophilia is some next level shit. I'm no one to tell you what to do, but I sincerely request you to proceed with the case and not drop it.

Wish more people had this ability to face off with such bullies. Karen is well justified to assume that a stranger who touched her daughter was a pedophile.

She saw just your skins and nothing beyond. She decided you are all below her and doesn't deserve to be in her presence, least of all talk to her. Through and through bigoted racist is what she is. Edit: Her story about stress is playing for sympathy. Their refusal to apologize to the guard while relentlessly pursuing your forgiveness says volumes. She is just trying to mitigate the damage and it's coming only from you. The Guard is of no threat or consequence to her, in other words he is nobody. And the Police encouraging you to settle is just natural sympathy to a woman so embedded in Arab culture. They are doing their job by being kind to a perceived weak person. It's so rare that such people get caught with evidence. Even rare that they pay for their crimes. If it was up to me, I would follow through and make it worse for her if I could. Do check if you can add child neglect to the list of charges. Her not taking care of her child is what triggered all of this. You are well within your rights, even morally obligated to carry this through and give her and their likes the right message by legal recourse. So stay put please if you can. Racism is one of the worst crimes against humanity. We have been trying to resolve it peacefully for centuries, rather unsuccessfully.

I stay in a big apartment complex and we have a rotation of security guards, I’ve been in this complex a while and know most of the guards (majority of whom are of African nationality). Anyway, Karen steps out of the lift and goes to talk to the reception. Karen’s daughter runs off and out of the building. I’m about to tell Karen that her daughter is out of the building when I see Karen’s daughter rushing to the road where cars are going super fast. The security guard on duty jumps out, grabs Karen’s daughter and pulls her back from the road and then brings her back to the building. I witnessed the whole thing. Karen comes running out of the building and starts SCREAMING that the security guard is a pedophile and how dare he touch her daughter like that? She starts saying all sorts of shit, accusing him of being a rapist and threatening to have him hung, drawn and quartered. The poor security guard looks like he wants to curl up and die. I stepped in and told Karen what actually happened and the security guard probably saved Karen’s daughter. Karen then rounds on me (I’m South Asian) and starts claiming that I’m in league with the security guard and accuses me of being a pedophile too. The receptionist comes out (a Filipina) and Karen screams she wants to speak to someone in-charge! She yells that she wants me and the security guard off the property immediately as we are pedophiles eyeing her daughter. At this point, I lost my temper and called the police. Karen kept screaming at us and told me, “go ahead, call the police!” Police eventually show up and the first thing they do is look at CCTV footage where it is totally clear that the security guard saved Karen’s daughter. I gave a statement to the police about all the awful things Karen was screaming about me and the security guard. Through the CCTV footage they can see Karen yelling, but can’t hear the words. Once Karen saw the footage, she got very quiet and then denied that she ever said any of those things. Thankfully, the receptionist took a recording halfway through Karen’s rant and you can clearly hear all the awful things she was saying. Then Karen totally changed her tune and started crying saying that seeing her daughter in danger she lost her mind and started apologising. I told the security guard he would be well within his rights to file a complaint. I certainly told Karen that I told the police in my statement that I want to file a complaint against her for defamation and anything else the police come up with. She cried harder and the police officer encouraged me to settle the matter and the security guard caved and dropped the matter. I said I’d think about it. This all happened about a week ago. A day or so after the incident, I went to the police and filed a complaint for defamation and harassment. I guess Karen got a notification about it and she came to my apartment. She asked to come in, but I didn’t trust her to claim something untoward happened because we were alone inside, so I said I didn’t want to speak to her alone and she should speak to the police and I shut the door. She started yelling that I needed to take back the complaint and banging on my door and I called security who eventually led her away. My neighbour in the apartment next door is witness to this entire scene. But then her husband came by and he explained that she’s under a lot of stress after she lost both her parents to covid during the pandemic. He also begged me to drop the complaint. Even the police is recommending I settle. Should I settle and drop the case? UPDATE #1 Her husband just came knocking again. I told him it’s 3AM and I have work tomorrow. He apologised but said that they cannot sleep because they’re so stressed because of the police complaint and they truly want to settle this and she’s very sorry. I asked him if he and his wife have apologised to the security guard and thanked him for saving their daughter? He didn’t say anything which I interpreted as a no. I told him not to come by my flat again and that I have no intention to settle. Whether she gets fined, deported or imprisoned, she deserves it for being a racist. He then started crying and saying they’re good people and his wife is not a racist, she’s made a mistake and he has no words to justify it but she’s not been the same since her parents died and he doesn’t know how to fix it. I basically herded him out of my flat and closed the door. Crazy effing shit. But now I feel really bad. UPDATE #2 Thanks everyone for your kind words and support. I thought a lot about what to do today and decided to go ahead with the complaint for now. A good friend of mine is a criminal lawyer and I called him and explained the whole thing. He’s agreed to take on the case at cost. He’s added more complaints for assault and intimidation. He’s also told the police not to contact me, but only him. This way the police can’t pressure me to settle. I also had another friend help me install a new camera near my door so I have evidence if they come back again. I spoke to the landlord’s office because I wanted permission to install the camera. The landlord’s company president called me. Once I told him my claim is going ahead, he said he will give me permission to install the camera. He also assured me that if I wanted, they would evict Karen and her family (apparently what she’s done with me wasn’t her first incident. She’s had issues with the landlord staff and has verbally insulted building cleaners and gardeners and tried to get people fired). I told the landlord can do whatever they want, but I don’t want to be the cause of someone losing their home. So I’m not sure if the landlord will go on to evict, but with the complaints against her and now a criminal case, the landlord may have cause. Lastly I spoke to my lawyer tonight who said that in most cases, there’s only a fine. But in most cases all that happens is someone uses abusive language or shows the middle finger. In this case, it was constant abuse and then she lied and came to my home and tried to intimidate me. There’s a strong chance here she might get some (a month max) of jail time. But that is up to the judge. In the meantime, she can’t travel and is stuck in the country until the case is resolved. I spoke to the security guard today and told him that if he changed his mind and wanted to file a complaint, I would support him and pay for my lawyer to represent his case. But he still didn’t want to go down that path, which is fine. I also thanked him for his bravery since he likely saved Karen’s daughter’s life and deserves to be praised. And that’s that. Now there’s nothing more for me to do but wait. It may take several months, but it doesn’t affect me. Thank you to everyone again! This Karen is going to get her comeuppance!']"

You can install upto 5 cds in these drives at a time and extract all their files unencrypted or semi encrypted to the PC. Encryption keys were available on the console directly anyway and public keys were usualy either Hacker, cracked or even leaked by the hundreds on pirating forums which allows you to setup a cd copier right at home. So encryption did not even matter much as there was always a way around it. But edited gta games were not heavily hacked, they just had assets added to them. I remember there was a saudi gta version with saudi buildings, a Pepsi man version, UAE version Syria version. Bored Arab programmers and developers would just take a copy of the game and add their assets to it which they usualy download for free online anyways. I remember talking to 35 years old programmer back in 2008 who did not even talk English but used to edit these games as a hobby. Wierd times for the gaming industry but it sure was a 100 times more liberal.', "">How did one even acquire these? Wouldn't they be expensive? >But what about games where fps and mechanics are tied together in such a way depending on the number of polygons or assets on screen? You know i was not any graphic developer so I did not really care about how they added the assets. But I really wanted to get in on the action of copying games and selling since it was insanely profitable even at 10 aed a CD for a ps2 game. I remember specifically been offered this large block which basically had 5 slots of cds and multiple hdds just to store game files on. It was offered with ps2 firmware and Microsoft Xbox firmware installed on the device which you would then control using a software in your personal computer. But not PC games for some reason. I remember that costed around 3k aed. But since I was a teenage back then I did not have that kind of money. The same people that used to sell DreamBox devices used to also sell this device. Along side hacking routers and a bunch of stuff. God bless the liberal software market pre 2011. But regarding polygons and assets, while am not an expert, am 100% certain that back then assets were not desplayed on a dedicated developer program or something like that like the case with community built games nowadays. They were assets built by 3d softwares and imported manually using a combination of raw coding in whatever language the game is coded on and 3d editing software of the entire map. Fps played little role as graphics were not so demanding anyway and ran on the CPU only, so there was no need to specifically build the game in such a way where you need to take advantage of performance boosting methods like ensuring assets fit well together. As I said am not an expert but I did chill with alot of game developers at that time."", ""Every Xbox version before Xbox one was easier to hack than even the ps2. But ps2 was easily hackable too. Am surprized you did not know that? This is also illegal but were not in the USA so we don't have swat teams breaking into our homes for copying a CD. Hacking router was a wifi sniffer on battery that can sniff packets while trying to connect to a given wifi to break into any home wifi system. You basicaly have free internet almost everywhere you go. This is obviously illegal so you should not ever do it. You can easily be sent to jail for such a breach. Am not sure what exactly caused what happend in 2011 but basicaly the whole internet structure started changing around the end of 2010. Stronger encryption played the biggest role. Security and privacy became a huge focus. I back that movement 100%. My whole company relies on security. If you have no security you lose privacy even at your own home. Also, Imagine taking years building a programs. But you go bankrupt cause everyone started copying that program and giving it for free. It's actually a shitty thing to do so while we are less liberal on the internet now. It's actualy a 100 times safer for everyone. About the physics in games back then, Am not sure. But I am sure physics played little role. However, the edited games were shit, to say the least. Playing the saudi version, you can drive through a whole building and fall off the map inside the building. Again am no expert at all, but I played alot of games and I can safely say they were shit edits of gta. But physics was not the problem though. A modded/added asset can still have its own unique set of rules of interaction with other older assets, regardless of the physics. But as I am nowhere near a game developer or computer scientist, I literaly have no knowledge about this. All assumptions based on what I've seen and heard. Also, yes, uae had Arabs that develope this shitty tiny indie games. They don't even speak English, but they hacked many local Arabic forums in uae back then. Lastly, dreambox is hard to explain. It's basicaly a box that hooks to the dsl internet, and has like 50,000 channels on it. Including explicit channels. It was illegal. And you pay no subscription. Just plug and suddenly you can watch paid channels like orbit for free. It did not need a dish or satellite. It was actually amazing.""]"

I've read documentaries on that there are passengers plane that have those type of radars, strange to see not all do. I didnt say planes do evasive maneuvers, it was the other guy, I said it was pretty easy for a plane to dodge a drone if say it wasn't near a jet engine Yeah I made a mistake, but then why would a drone fl y near a airport, isn't that considered a no drone fly zone"", 'I didnt say am wrong, I said, stop trying to prove as if am wrong. I didn\'t say you said that planes don\'t have radars, and yes you\'d be surprised with the many types of radar with some being high tech enough to provide good details. Most people here in the comment section go off context or attempt to twist some words. Planes indeed do have radars, it\'s common sense, similar to cars having a GPS. others keep using ""Passanger Planes"" as a example plane, yet there are other highly used planes including military planes, which both do have radars of some type. Other arguments are simply either off context and try to twist up some words to have something to throw at me or don\'t provide actual source and just throw anything. So far I only seen 2-3 people actually being intelligent here, rest are just idiots that keep going off context and have no valid arguments. So far, the only valid argument i seen is me saying that jet engine push air instead of suck it in, which i do admit. However, I stand by my claim with radars as it\'s a fact, just do basic research which few others failed to do so.', ""Lol mate, you've shown over and over you don't know what you are talking about in terms of drones entering elevations used by planes and how jet engines would push a drone out of the way. And now you want us to trust you that passenger planes are flying around with radars that can detect a drone less than 50cm wide and 10cm tall? If Heathrow didn't have radar capable of detecting drones in 2015 and was looking for a solution there is no way most, if any, commercial planes are flying with such a radar. The closest we have to the concept.you are talking about is DJI's implementation of ADS-B receivers in their newer drones (note: I don't actually know if they do have this as my drone is older than their press release). This allows the drone to warn it's pilot of a nearby plane or helicopter but not the other way around.""]"

I am not sure if this happened as you exactly describe it. It is rather strange…My comment is not about the attitude you described but rather about the usage of the elevators as a general rule lol yes they are public, yes anyone can take them but for God sake people remember it’s really for people with disabilities, pregnant ladies, families with toddlers and push chairs and elderly people in wheelchairs. From locals/expats perspective i am not calling you lazy but many people don’t understand why people that can walk use Dubai malls bloody crowded elevators. It doesn’t make sense to wait for an elevator for 15/20min because people that can take the escalator in front are too lazy to do so. It is just not courteous, annoying and it does get people in their nerves. Most of the time it is Indians/South Asians (be it singles, couples or even Deliveroo and Talabat guys) or some lost tourists and it really gets on the nerves of people that push strollers or wheelchairs…and have to wait forever So I’m not saying what happened to you is ok but I gave you another perspective to how people see things. If your mum can walk, avoid the lift and if she cannot and she is in a wheelchair don’t give priority to anyone because you have the right to go first.
